# Automated Login

Just a simple automated test in [Python](https://python.org) with [Selenium](https://www.selenium.dev/)

The test is based in entering the right user and password in a page called [Saucedemo](https://www.saucedemo.com/) which is a page to practice automation.

## Features

- Import a Unittest.
- Import Selenium Webdriver and Keys.
- Import Time.

> Note: `Time` module is to make the automation to wait for the page to load (this is not the optimal way to do it).
